# Various-Calculators-Python
Personal passion project based on a calculator that provides you with answers for those pesky problems that involve mathematical formulas.

To expand and reiterate on what my description says, this is in fact a calculator that will provide you with answers for questions that involve the usage of formulas. I am basing this project off my own personal experiences with math as a college student currently enrolled in a Pre-Calculus course. I'm sure we've all had our fair share of snippets of problems that involve us finding an answer for a problem that will a complicated formula right? Some of us already know how to solve it and simply want to course through to other difficult problems that are worth our attention and this is why I am building the "Various Calculators" program which will consist of algebraic and trigonometric formulas in their own respective tabs within the program. 

Why am I making this program?:
- I aim for this program to help save me time, even if just by a tiny margin
- This program might be helpful to others who are in the same predicament as I am
- I plan to hone my skills in Python, learning about libraries and the limitless potential it brings

My vision for this project:
- I would love to complete this program before the spring semester ends, so I can continue making more projects!
- I plan to use the libraries NumPY and CustomTKinter in order to maximize the potential of this program with my current skills
- Currently only adding a section for formulas commonly used in Algebra and Pre-Calculus level courses, but I plan to extend sections as I take higher level math courses over time.
- Once I'm done with the programming in the main.py, calculator_logic.py, and gui.py files I have made, I will also try to insert information into buttons I have made for each individual formula with steps to take in order to solve problems involving these formulas. This way, a user will have the capability to learn how to solve these problems involving formulas by themselves!

Needless to say, I am very excited about this project as I know I will be using it often!
